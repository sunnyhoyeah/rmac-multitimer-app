# Staged Deployment Strategy: v1.1.1 and v1.1.2

## Overview
The fixes have been split into two separate releases for staged deployment:
- **v1.1.1**: Critical null safety fix only
- **v1.1.2**: All UI/UX improvements and overflow fixes

## v1.1.1 - Critical Null Check Fix (Deploy First)

### Branch: `release/v1.1.1`
### Tag: `v1.1.1-null-fix`
### Version: `1.1.1+102`

### Changes:
- ✅ **Added null-safe `_getTimerState()` method** to prevent "Null check operator used on a null value" errors
- ✅ **Updated TimerRow instantiations** to use `_getTimerState(index)` instead of `timerStates[_getTimerStateId(index)]!`
- ✅ **Critical production stability fix** for timer state management

### Why Deploy First:
- Fixes crashes and null pointer exceptions
- Essential for app stability
- Minimal risk - only adds null safety
- Quick to deploy and validate

### Deployment Command:
```bash
git checkout release/v1.1.1
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build ios --release
```

## v1.1.2 - UI/UX Improvements (Deploy Second)

### Branch: `release/v1.1.2`  
### Tag: `v1.1.2-ui-improvements`
### Version: `1.1.2+103`

### Changes:
- ✅ **Includes all fixes from v1.1.1** (null safety)
- ✅ **Set drawer width to 155px** to prevent covering timer and runner names
- ✅ **Fixed RenderFlex overflow** in distance time drag control using FittedBox and constraints
- ✅ **Reduced font sizes** for better space utilization in pace calculator
- ✅ **Refactored drag control layout** with smaller font sizes and responsive design
- ✅ **Enhanced user experience** with improved drawer behavior and responsive text sizing

### Why Deploy Second:
- Contains visual and layout improvements
- Builds upon the stability of v1.1.1
- Can be deployed after v1.1.1 is verified stable
- Lower risk after critical fix is in production

### Deployment Command:
```bash
git checkout release/v1.1.2
flutter build apk --release
# or  
flutter build ios --release
```

3. Verify null safety fix works
4. Wait 24-48 hours for stability confirmation

### Phase 2: v1.1.2 (After Phase 1 Stable)
1. Deploy v1.1.2 to production
2. Monitor UI/UX improvements
3. Verify drawer behavior and overflow fixes
4. Complete deployment cycle

## Verification Commands

### Check v1.1.1 has only null fix:
```bash
git checkout release/v1.1.1
grep -n "_getTimerState" lib/main.dart
grep -n "panelWidth = 155" lib/main.dart  # Should NOT exist
```

### Check v1.1.2 has all fixes:
```bash
git checkout release/v1.1.2  
grep -n "_getTimerState" lib/main.dart     # Should exist
grep -n "panelWidth = 155" lib/main.dart  # Should exist
```

Both versions compile successfully with only lint warnings (no critical errors).
