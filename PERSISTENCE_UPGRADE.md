# Persistence Upgrade: Survives App Updates

## Problem Solved
Previously, the app used `SharedPreferences` to store runner names and row count, which worked for app restarts but was cleared when users updated the app to a new version.

## Solution Implemented
Implemented a robust dual-storage persistence system that ensures user data survives app updates:

### Key Improvements

1. **Document Directory Storage**
   - Added `path_provider` dependency for access to app's documents directory
   - Documents directory data persists across app updates (unlike SharedPreferences)
   - Data is stored as JSON in `runner_data.json` file

2. **Dual Storage System**
   - Continues to save to SharedPreferences for backwards compatibility
   - Also saves to document directory for update-proof persistence
   - Load priority: Document directory first, then SharedPreferences fallback

3. **Automatic Migration**
   - If document directory is empty but SharedPreferences has data, automatically migrates
   - Ensures existing users don't lose their custom runner names during first update

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks around all persistence operations
   - Graceful fallback if either storage method fails
   - Debug logging for troubleshooting

### Technical Details

#### Storage Structure (Document Directory)
```json
{
  "runnerNames": ["Runner 1", "Custom Name", "Runner 3"],
  "version": "1.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-24T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Storage Methods
- `saveRunnerNames()`: Saves to both SharedPreferences and document directory
- `loadRunnerNames()`: Loads from document directory first, falls back to SharedPreferences
- `_saveToDocumentDirectory()`: Internal method for document directory operations
- `_loadFromDocumentDirectory()`: Internal method for document directory operations

## User Benefits
- ✅ Runner names and row count persist through app updates
- ✅ Custom runner names are never lost
- ✅ Backwards compatible with existing installations
- ✅ No user action required - migration happens automatically

## Validation
- ✅ Successfully builds with `flutter build ios --no-codesign`
- ✅ All persistence methods include error handling
- ✅ Maintains backwards compatibility
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to repository

## Files Modified
- `lib/main.dart`: Enhanced persistence methods
- `pubspec.yaml`: Added `path_provider: ^2.1.1` dependency
- `test/widget_test.dart`: Fixed import issues

This upgrade ensures that users will never lose their custom runner names and timer configurations when updating the app, providing a much better user experience.
